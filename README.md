# Till Test
*In progress*


A practice tech test from Makers Academy. We will be modelling a till for a coffee shop

### Version 1

Implement a system that contains the business logic to produce a receipt, based on a json price list and test orders. A sample .json file has been provided with the list of products sold at this particular coffee shop.

Your receipt must calculate and show the correct amount of tax (in this shop's case, 8.64%), as well as correct line totals and total amount. Do not worry about calculating discounts or change yet. Consider what output formats may be suitable.

### Version 2

Add functionality to take payment and calculate correct change.
Add functionality to handle discounts - in this example, a 5% discount on orders over $50, and a 10% muffin discount.

### Version 3

Implement an user interface that can actually be used as a till.

You may use whatever technologies you see fit.
